How to fix the Compiler Error:

If you are getting an error like the one below when you run the robot it is most likely because the expression customersData(rowNumber)("last name").toString cannot be indexed:

ERROR MESSAGE: Compiler error(s) encountered processing expression "customersData(rowNumber)("last name").toString". Class 'System.Data.DataTable' cannot be indexed because it has no default property.

To solve this proplem, add .Rows like below:

customersData.Rows(rowNumber)("last name").toString

You will need to add .Rows for all the "Type Into" activities which use a similar expression.

The reason it worked for me in the video and not for you is because i was using an older version of UiPath and an update must've changed this.
